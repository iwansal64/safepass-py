# safepass-py
It is used for saving password
I still use it for my own from now because it still ugly and shit but if you want to get it just clone like this `git clone https://github.com/iwansal64/safepass-py.git`, then `cd safepass-py` and then run `install.sh`. Don't forget to make it executable first though by typing `sudo chmod +x ./install.sh`
